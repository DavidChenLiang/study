<dt><b>Introduction</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>Once upon a time terminals were physical objects.
	They had video screens with a fixed number of rows 
	and columns.  The DEC vt100 was a popular model.  It
	had 25 lines and 80 columns.  It could operate in 132
	column mode, but few people had the visual acuity to
	tolerate that mode.
	<p>
	Now terminals are virtual things.  They appear as
	windows on a `desktop' and can be resized to any 
	combination of lines and columns.
	<p>
	How can a program adjust its display to fit into the
	lines x cols combo the user has selected?
	<p>
	</dd>
<dt><b>A demo program</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	The following program: box.c, shows how a program
	can trap <b><font size=-1>SIGWINCH</font></b> to notice changes in window
	size and redraw the screen to match.
	<p>
	Compile this program with<pre>
	cc box.c -lcurses -o box
	</pre>
	And run it.  You can resize the window and see that
	it responds.  The code lacks comments so you can add
	your own as you figure out how it works.

 *		 On SIGWINCH, re-read window size and redraw
 *		 on SIGINT, close up and go
