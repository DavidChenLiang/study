<h4>
Writing an X-Windows version of Pong
</h4>
	<blockquote>
	If you would like a brief introduction to programming for X-windows (using the
	low-level Xlib library) take a look in 
	<a href=xpong/>~COURSE/hw/netpong/xpong</a> for a solution to pong written
	by a student a few years back.  If you want to use this as a basis
	for netpong, that's fine.

<h4>
What is my hostname?
</h4>
	<blockquote>
	When you stat up a server, you need to know the machine the
	server is running on so you know what machine to connect to.
	The way to do this is to type <tt>hostname</tt> . That command
	will report your current machine.
	<p>
	</blockquote>
<h4>
Do I need to call connect and accept before each transaction?
</h4>
	<blockquote>
	No.  You can read and write all you like.  The reason
	a typical server loops making several connections,
	one after another, is that it is going to provide
	services for lots of clients, one per connections.
	With netpong, though, you have one connection but
	lots of read-write exchanges, sort of like a ping
	pong game.

<h4>
Is there any easy way to create and parse inter-game messages ?
</h4>
	<blockquote>
	You bet!  <tt>sprintf</tt> and <tt>sscanf</tt> are
	your friends here. You can examine the code to srv.c
	and clnt.c for the license server to see how they
	build and read tickets.  Here are the relevant lines
	from those programs:
	<xmp>
	char replybuf[BIGENOUGH];

	sprintf(replybuf, "TICK %d.%d", ticket_array[x], x);

	...

	/* msg looks like  GBYE 1234.0 parse out pid and slot */

	if((sscanf((msg_p + 5), "%d.%d", &pid, &slot) != 2) ||
	   (ticket_array[slot] != pid)) {
	</xmp>
	You can generalize from those to creating a <tt>BALL</tt>
	message on one end and reading it on the other end.
