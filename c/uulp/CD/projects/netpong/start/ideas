Dual-Mode
----------------
One idea is to have the game, while waiting in server mode,
to run in the original single-user pong game.  That will
wait for a connection but play normally with three walls.

When a connection is made, the opposite wall could change
from | into . (or :) and then become a net.  When the
other player checked out, the game could revert to its
single-player, waiting mode.

Another option is if the client program found that the
opponent quit it could revert to single play mode and
become a serer able to accept a connection.
