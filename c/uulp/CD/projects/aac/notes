I've been looking at some of the aac projects and noticed
that some people read a lot of records into memory and
keep them there.  One solution I looked at read in all
sessions for all users into a linked list with a login
time and logout time.  Then, when it hit EOF, it consulted
the list to find the total time for each user in the list.
For really large wtmp files, this approach is risky as
well as inefficient in terms of:

        a) space - uses lots more than it needs
        b) time  - searching one long linked list for
                   each record does not scale well
                   particularly since each new open session
                   adds to the list
                         
On the other hand, the design has a certain clear modularity:

        1) read in all sessions
        2) foreach user in list
                user_total = 0
                foreach session in list
                        if session.logname == user
                                user_total += session.time
                print user_total
                total_total += user_total

But the implied space limitation and the n^2 time behavior is
poor design.
