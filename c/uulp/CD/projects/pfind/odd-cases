 > Hi Bruce and TA folks,

 > ice% find ~COURSE/hw/pfind -name pfind

 > find: /home/COURSE/hw/pfind/pft2.d/d2/d2: Permission denied

 > My understanding from the above is that find compares the final 
   dirname in the starting_search_dir with search_str and displays 
   them if they match(cases 2 and 4 confirm that it does a strcmp).
 > I have added a new Test Scenario (case 5) in test.pfind which I 
   think would be a good test.
