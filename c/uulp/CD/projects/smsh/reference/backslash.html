The Four-Backslash Problem

	<blockquote>
	When you type  <tt>echo \\</tt> to the bourne shell, it
	prints back <tt>\</tt> which is what you would expect.
	If you type  <tt>echo \\\\</tt> to the bourne shell, it
	prints back <tt>\</tt> which is not what I would expect.
	The korn shell also prints one backslash for four.  Bash, 
	though prints two.  The bourne shell prints two when asked 
	to print six .

  Quoting Mechanisms


  The following	characters have	a special meaning to the shell and cause ter-
  mination of a	word unless quoted:

       ; &amp; ( ) | ^ &lt; &gt; &lt;newline&gt; &lt;space&gt; &lt;tab&gt;

  Using	' ' (single) and " " (double) quotes to	surround a string or a \
  (backslash) before a single character	enables	the character to stand for
  itself, instead of conveying special meaning to the shell.

  Within single	quotes,	all characters (except the single quote	character
  itself), are taken literally,	with any special meaning removed.  Thus,
  entering:

       stuff='echo $? $*; ls * | wc'

  results only in the literal string echo $? $*; ls * |	wc being assigned to
  the stuff variable; the echo,	ls, and	wc commands are	not executed, nor are
  the variables	$? and $* and the special character * expanded by the shell.

  To verify this you could export the variable stuff with the command export
  stuff, and then use the command printenv stuff to view it.  This is differ-
  ent from the simple command echo $stuff.

  Within double	quotes,	the special meaning of certain characters ($, `, and
  ") does persist, while all other characters are taken	literally. Thus,
  within double	quotes,	command	and variable substitution takes	place.	In
  addition, the	quotes do not affect the commands within a command substitu-
  tion that is part of the quoted string, so characters	there retain their
  special meanings.

  Consider the following sequence:

  You enter:

       ls *

  System displays:

       file1
       file2
       file3

  You enter:

       message="This directory contains	`ls * `	"
       echo $message

  System displays:

       This directory contains file1 file2 file3

  This shows that the *	special	character inside the command substitution was
  expanded.

  <font color=blue>
  To hide the special meaning of $, `, and " within double quotes, precede
  these	characters with	a \ (backslash). Outside of double quotes, preceding
  a character with \ (backslash) is equivalent to placing it within single
  quotes.  Hence, a \ (backslash) immediately preceding	the newline character
  (that	is, a \	(backslash) at the end of the line) hides the newline charac-
  ter and allows you to	continue the command line on the next physical line.

	Notice the section in blue.  It says that <tt>\x</tt> is equivalent
        to <tt>x</tt> .  If that is true, then  <tt>\\</tt> must be equivalent
	to <tt>\</tt>.  But what does the shell do with that backslash?  Does
	the shell now apply that backslash to the next character in 
	the line?  If so, is the string <tt>\\\</tt> the same 
	as <tt>\\</tt> which is <tt>\</tt> ?  When does it stop?

<h4>
What does the Source Say?

<blockquote>
	Search the Web for the source to the Bourne shell or the source
	for the korn shell (http://kornshell.com).  The Bourne shell
	source shows that the first <tt>\\</tt> actually turns 
	into <tt>""</tt>.
