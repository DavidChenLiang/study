<dt><b>Buffering</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	It is inefficient to read the file backwards record by
	record if you call read() to get each record.  It is
	much better programming to read the file in bunches
	of records and then traverse the bunch within your own
	program.
	<p>

	This picture shows the idea of reading the file
	in bunches.
	<p>
	You pick a bunch size.  You then read that many structs
	from the end of the file and remember how far from the
	end you started.
	<p>
	Then, your program traverses the bunch in reverse order.
	The bunch is just an array.  When your position indicator
	runs off the start of the array, you need to go back to
	the file and read in the next bunch.

<dt><b>Testing Buffering</b></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>
	One way to test your buffering logic independtly of
	the llast logic is to write a buffered version of
	the dumputmp.c program.  Instead of reading the
	wtmp file in forward order, change dumputmp.c so it
	reads the file backwards using buffering. 
	<p>
	Once that is working, you can apply that buffered
	reverse-reading library to the llast logic.
