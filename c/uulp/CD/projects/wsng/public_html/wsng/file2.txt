This file is plain, unadorned text.  It does not
contain any special formatting tags.  It does not
contain a picture, a musical selection, or a
multi-media presentation.

Its name is file2.txt  .
The .txt extension tells the server to put into
the HTTP header the string

   Content-type: text/plain

and the browser uses that header information to
know to display the content in a text-based format.
