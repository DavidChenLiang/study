Welcome to a list of some green vegetables.<br>
This list is not complete.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this directory is to show how a server<br>
handles 'GET'ing the contents of a directory.<br>
<br>
If the directory contains a file called <br><br>
<i>index.html</i><br>
it presents that file as the contents of the directory.<br>

If there is no such file, it opens the directory<br>
and returns its own html stream with the contents.<br>
