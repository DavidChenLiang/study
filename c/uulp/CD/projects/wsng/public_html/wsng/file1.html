<p>
This file contains text with html tags.  The
name of the file is file1.html.  The .html
extension tells the server the file is an
html file. The server uses that information
to include in the HTTP header lines the
message:
<p>
<center>
<b>Content-type: text/html</b>
</center>
</p>
and the browser takes it from there.
