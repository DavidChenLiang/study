<dt><b> Command line editing and cbreak mode</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	When you are using the default version of the c-shell on this
	system, you can press the ESC key to edit previous commands.
	<p>
	You don't need to press Return, just ESC.  That means the tty
	is in cbreak mode.  If it were not in cbreak mode, the shell
	would not see you input until you pressed the Return key.
	<p>
	The csh uses the new tty driver, which is different from the
	standard one.
	<p>
	The Bourne shell, invoked by typing  sh  , does not do anything
	weird with the tty driver, but it does interpret the ^ character
	as if it were the | character.  ( Original Unix used ^ for
	pipelines rather than the | symbol.)
	<p>
	moral: use the bourne shell to test your program but quote the
	caret with  "^" or '^' or \^ to prevent the shell from 
	misinterpreting your meaning.

<dt><b>The Caret-X problem</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	I've tried to run the program as follows:
	<p>
	<blockquote><pre>
		$ ./stty004 erase ^G
		G: not found
		$ ./stty004 erase ^G              
		G: not found
		$ exit
		ws11% pwd
		/home/lee
		ws11% ls
		News         hw1prt3.txt  pdfind       sttyl
		blank        mail         pdfind2      watch
		ws11% cd sttyl
		ws11% pwd
		/home/lee/sttyl
		ws11% ./stty004 erase ^G
		erase
		erase, ^G
		erase, 3
		argu 3: ^
		EXIT set_char
		ws11% 
	</pre></blockquote>
	<p>
	The caret is an ancient notation for the pipe sign.  You
	need to quote it as in <b>stty erase "^H"</b>
	<p>
	</dd>
<dt><b>Control Chars</b></dt>
<dd>
	<p>
	In stty, special-character setting strings are not 
	necessarily alphabetical at all (man page reprinted below).  
	The issue that I have for sttyl is the
	possibility of non-alphabetical control characters, 
	i.e, undef or ^$   (Is
	there even an ASCII code for ^$, for instance?)
	<p>
	How can these be handled in sttyl, if at all?  I don't 
	imagine the "add 'A' trick" for printing ^alpha control 
	characters will work.....
	<p>
	<pre>
	 special-character string
             Sets special-character to string.  The special character is 
             set to the first character in string and subsequent characters 
             are ignored, with the following exceptions:

        o  The stringss undef and ^- set the special character to
           {_POSIX_VDISABLE} if it is in effect for the device.

        o  The string ^? sets the special character to <Delete>.

        o  Any other string beginning with the character ^ sets the special
           character to the control character corresponding to the second
           character of string (subsequent characters are ignored).  For
           example, the string ^c sets the special character to ^C; the
           string ^zq sets the special character to ^Z.
