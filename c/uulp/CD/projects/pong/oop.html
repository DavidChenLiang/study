<b>Don't Overdo OO Design</b>
<blockquote>
	The purpose of asking you to separate the ball storage and
	functions from the rest of the code is to acquaint you with
	basic design principles and techniques for modular coding
	in C.  I am not expecting you to similate classes and 
	methods for this assignment.  
	<p>
	All you really need to do
	is to build a file called ball.c and a file called ball.h
	to hide the internals of the ball and present a clear
	interface.
	<p>
	The following example is not a requirement, and it may
	not even be the best fit for your code.

<b>A Potential Direction</b>

Object Oriented Ideas for Pong
<p>
If you want to add multiple pladdles or multiple balls to the game,
the best solution is to dynamically create paddles and balls.  In your
ball.c file, for example, define a constructors that allocate a 
struct for the object, initialize the values, and returns a pointer to
a ball.  The code could look like:
<pre>

     BALL *new_ball(char ballsym, int y, int x)
     {
           BALL * retval;
           retval = malloc(sizeof(struct ppb));
           if ( retval == NULL )
                fatal("out of memory in new_ball");
           retval->sym = ballsym;
           retval->xttm = retval->xttg = 0;
           retval->yttm = retval->yttg = 0;
	   retval->x    = x;
	   retval->y    = y;
           return retval;
     }

</pre>
That way, the main program could allocate as many as it pleased.
This is much more flexible than the static var mentioned for the
simple solution.
