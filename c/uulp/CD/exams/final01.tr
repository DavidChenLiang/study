15. This problem explores the question of designing a simple
communications program for Unix. 

First, some background.  You attach a modem to a Unix
system.  It appears as the file /dev/modem in the device directory.
You can open it as you open any input/output device.  When you write
a character into the file, it goes out the wire into the modem.  When
you read from this file, you get the next character that comes in over
the wire from the modem. 

Now, for the purpose of the program.  A simple communications program
allows you to connect from your terminal to the modem.  The operation of
such a program sounds simple:  \fB(1)\fR any characters you type 
on your keyboard get sent out over the modem line, (this includes
things like Ctrl-C and backspace); \fB(2)\fR any 
characters that come in from the modem go to your screen; \fB(3)\fR
when you type some special key combination (like \s8NEWLINE ~ .\s0)
the program closes the connection and exits.

\fBPart a: A Non-Unix Solution\fR  First, consider a method that
works on the simplest PC's: polling.  A simple implementation of
such a program is one that continuously polls the two input sources.
If there is a character available at the keyboard, it gets it and
writes it to the modem; it then goes to the modem: if there is a character
available at the modem, it gets it and writes it to the screen; it then
goes to the keyboard...

Explain how you would implement such a solution under Unix.  What
system calls would you have to make to initialize the
program?  What system calls would you make in the polling loop?
Then explain the drawback of this method.

\fBPart b) A Unix Solution\fR The Unix solution to this problem is
to use two processes, one to carry characters from the modem to the
screen, the other to carry characters from the keyboard to the modem.
Sounds simple?   Discuss this solution by answering the following
questions:
.in +0.2i
.ll -0.2i

i) Why does this solution eliminate the drawback of the polled method?

ii) What initialization does this program have to do to get started?
What files does it need to open?  How does it get the other process?
Does it matter if the files are opened before the other process is
created?

iii) How should this program manage signals?  Why?

iv) How should this program handle tty driver settings?  Why?

v) How should this program handle the `get me out' key sequence?  In
particular, what wrapup operations does it need to perform and how
will it do them?
