<dl>
<dt>What
<dd>
	This CD contains 12 complete final exams.  These
	are exams I used in my course.  Students had two
	hours for the exam, and most of these exams were about
	the right length for that time.  The exams are numbered
	in chronological order.
	<p>
	These are not secret; copies are on file in the 
	Harvard Extension School library.  On the other hand,
	any student who goes to the trouble to get copies of
	all these exams and figure out answers to all the questions
	will probably learn a lot.
	<p>
	
<dt>Design
<dd>
	All the exams test factual knowledge, basic skills used in
	one or two of the programming projects, and understanding
	of Unix programming design. 
	<p>
	There are many good answers to most of these questions,
	particularly the programming and design questions.
	The number of points per question is pretty low, so it
	is not hard to make up fair grading even for a variety
	of answers.
	<p>
	You are of course free to cut, paste, edit, delete these 
	questions in any way you like.
	<p>

<dt>File Format
<dd>
	The exams are coded with troff markup tags.  The exams
	use the <b>tbl</b> table preprocessor language, too.  
	The exams directory contains a script called MakeExam 
	to convert the source file into pdf.  MakeExam takes 
	the name of a troff file as
	an argument and writes pdf output to standard output.  Therefore,
	<pre>
	MakeExam finalXX.tr > final.pdf
	</pre>
	will work.  If you want, instead, to create Postscript, do this:
	<pre>
	tbl finalXX.tr | groff -Tps > finalXX.ps
	</pre>
	The script called MakeExams takes the names of one or more
	exam files on the command line and creates pdf files with
	corresponding names.  For example:
	<pre>
	MakeExams *.tr
	</pre>
	will generate pdf versions of all the exams.
