<dt>Classroom Material: Outline, Source Code, Slides
<dd>
	The classroom material consists of:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Lecture outline
		<li>Sample programs
		<li>Listings of sample programs
		<li>Blackboard images/Slideshow
		<li>Printout of slideshow
	</ul>
	<p>
	The material has been used for two-hour classes.
	The lecture outline and code follow the topics
	in the text closely but not exactly.
	In this section, I'll explain what my own classes look like
	and how I use the teaching material.

<dt>Class Outline
<dd>
	The outline is a one-page agenda for the class.
	The outline includes the main topic for the class, 
	the main examples, and the sequence of ideas, questions, and
	answers.  Students and teachers both know what to expect
	and where they are going.
	The lecture outlines are in the "handouts" directory in
	files called <i>outline##.pdf</i>, <i>outline##.txt</i> ,
	and <i>outline##.tr</i>.
	A typical outline looks like 
	<a href='samples/outline03.pdf'>this one</a>
	from class 3.
	<p>
	The class outline corresponds to the sequence of topics
	and images on the lecture slides.  See below for information
	about the slides.
	<p>
	
<dt>Sample Code
<dd>
	During class, I write programs that demonstrate what
	Unix does, how programs work, and how to use system calls.
	The students receive printed copies of the source code to
	all those programs.  They can look at them before class starts,
	write notes during class, and review them later.  
	Many students use them as their main notepad.
	The sample program printouts are in the "handouts" directory in
	files called <i>samples##.pdf</i>, <i>samples##.txt</i> ,
	and <i>samples##.tr</i>.
	A typical page of sample programs looks like 
	<a href='samples/samples03.pdf'>this one</a>
	from class 3.
	<p>
	The actual programs, in source form, are in the directory
	called "code".  
	These are the files you can copy to your machine and
	use during lecture if you plan to compile and run programs
	during class.  They are similar to many programs in the
	book.  
	<p>
<dt>Other Handouts
<dd>
	In addition to the class outline and sample code listings,
	some lectures have other handouts.  These documents provide
	extra explanations or illustrations of class topics.
	<p>
<dt>Blackboards and Slideshows
<dd>
	I write on the blackboard during class.  Much of the
	narrative of the lecture is written on the blackboard.
	I have included
	these blackboard images in the form of slideshows.
	The slideshows come in HTML and PowerPoint versions.
	The blackboard images use chalk color font on a blackboard
	color background.  If you don't like that color scheme, the
	slideshows also come in a whiteboard version, with black
	font on white background.
	<p>
	If you prefer to make your own slides with nicer graphics
	and your own labels and text, you can use the clipart
	provided for each chapter.  Each chapter has a clipart 
	section that contains full-color, computer-rendered 
	versions of all the images in the book.  You can paste 
	these images into any presentation program, add your 
	own labels, arrows, and text, to build your own version.  
	If you base your work on the slides provided, you can 
	do a new lecture pretty quickly.
	<p>
	I used the clipart images to make HTML slides for chapters
	1 and 15.  
	</p>

<dt>Page of Slides
<dd>
	The slides directory also has a subdirectory called "onepage"
	which contains all the slide images
	in one document.  Students often print this out before class
	and use it to follow along, adding notes, to the lecture
	images.  For example, the onepage version for
	directory of class 10 looks like
	<a href='samples/onepage10.html'>this</a>.
	</p>

<dt>File Format
<dd>
	Class outlines and sample code handouts are written using troff
	formating tags.  You can convert the file into Postscript
	or pdf with standard Unix tools.  
	To convert a file into Postscript using groff, do this:
	<pre>
	groff -Tps XXX.tr > XXX.ps
	</pre>
	If you do not have groff (which is free software) you might
	have troff; many versions of Unix include troff.  
	<p>
	If you want to to convert that Postscript file to pdf format, 
	you can use the ghostscript program, freely available 
	for Unix and some other platforms.  Use this command
	<pre>
	gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=XXX.pdf -q -dNOPAUSE - < XXX.ps
	</pre>
	The manual explains what it all means.  gs can also convert
	Postscript files into many other formats.
	</p>

<dt>Classes and Text
<dd>
	The classes do not cover all the material in the text.
	The classes sometimes offer slightly different approaches to the 
	material.  Some of the class examples are simpler than ones in 
	the text because people have less time to absorb complex
	programs in class.
