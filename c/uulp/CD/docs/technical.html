	<span class="header">How I Teach with<br>
<i>Understanding Unix/Linux Programming</i></span><br>


	<i>Understanding Unix/Linux Programming</i> and all
	the material in this package are based on my
	course called <i>Unix Systems Programming</i>.
	The course follows a pretty standard model.

	<p>

<dl>
<dt>Classes
<dd>
	I give a two-hour class each week.  I have a
	Unix system and a screen projector so everyone
	can see what I type and run on the system.
	I demonstrate programs, explain how Unix works,
	write code, and discuss the ideas and techniques.
	<p>
	The lecture material consist of:
	<ul>
		<li>Class Outline - the agenda
		<li>Sample Code - discuss code, run programs
		<li>Blackboard Images (as slides)
	</ul>
	<p>
	This Instructor's Resource package
	includes outlines, code, and images for
	all fifteen chapters.  You can print out the handouts, 
	copy the source code to your machine, show the slides, 
	and explain how things work.
	<p> 
	<i>Using Unix during Classes</i>
	<p>
	Having a live system during class allows me to answer
	questions by demonstrating, rather than stating, the answers.
	If a student asks "<i>What would happen if you changed that line
	to read..</i>", I can make the change to the code, compile it, and
	see what happens.  By using Unix to teach, I try to encourage students
	to try similar experiments with sample code outside of class.
	<p>
	
<dt>Projects
<dd>
	I assign six programming projects during the term.
	Students have two to three weeks to do each one.
	Each assignment is a complete Unix program, based
	on ideas and code from class and reading, designed
	to provide practice with the material and also to
	offer chances for more exploration and discovery.
	<p>
	This package has twelve projects.  You can use the
	projects as they are.  Simply add your course name 
	and change some directory paths in the document, 
	then print them out.  These are not simple projects, 
	but students find them interesting and worth the work.
	<p> 
<dt>Discussions
<dd>
	I meet with students, and teaching assistants
	conduct discussion sessions.  During these meetings,
	we usually focus on the programming projects.  I use the
	project to emphasize certain elements of how Unix works and
	what the API offers.  I ask students about their design
	ideas for their solutions, and I use the time to discuss
	software design, data structures, and algorithms.
	<p> 
<dt>Exams
<dd>
	I give a final exam.  This package has all twelve final exams 
	I gave.  You can use them as models, cut and paste from them, 
	or use them as they are.  Other people have copies of them, 
	so they are not completely secure.
	<p>
<dt>Overall
<dd>
	The course has worked well in this format all its twelve years.
	The clean, sensible design of Unix makes sense to students,
	and the approach of studing real programs and writing real
	programs keeps people motivated.
