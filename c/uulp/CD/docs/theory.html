<dt>Project-Based Teaching
<dd>
	<i>Understanding Unix/Linux Programming</i> and all
	the material in this package use a project-based 
	teaching approach.  Each chapter explains Unix ideas
	and techniques as answers to practical problems.
	<p>
	Each chapter, class, and programming project starts
	by presenting a problem, then explains the ideas and tools,
	and then develops a solution.
	<p>
	The book uses a single pattern, but addresses three
	goals and uses four modes of expression.
	<p> 
<dt>First, the Single Pattern
<dd>
	Most chapters in the book and class outlines 
	follow the same pattern.  The pattern is
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li>Here's some problem or task we need done
	<li>Here's a Unix program that does it
	<li>Let's see what the program does
	<li>Gee, I wonder how that works
	<li>Well, here's how Unix (i.e. the kernel) does it
	<li>Here are the basic principles and model the kernel uses
	<li>But how does the program get at those services?
	<li>Easy, these API calls provide access to those services
	<li>Oh, so those ideas, structures, and calls do it all
	<li>Let's write some programs that use those calls
	<li>Let's write some similar programs 
	</ol>
	<p>
	The flow of topics is consistent: First, the user experience
	of the program, then a look at the basic principles behind the
	program, and finally, the return to the user experience
	by means of the API.  The API is portrayed as the answer to 
	the question: "How can those basic principles solve these
	practical problems?"  The API is the connection between
	principles and practice.  
	<p> 
	<dt>The Three Goals
	<dd>
	The preface states the purpose of the book is to
	explain how Unix works and show how to write programs
	that use the Unix kernel. The course has one more goal,
	to introduce and reinforce topics in computer science 
	and software engineering.  Recursion, finite state
	machines, race conditions, linked data structures, and
	many other ideas are the fabric of a well-designed
	system.  In class discussions, in the text, and in
	examples, I try to show people how these basic principles
	apply to practical problems in basic tools and kernel services.
	<p> 
<dt>Four Modes of Expression
<dd>
	The topics are how Unix works, how to program Unix,
	and computer science and software engineering.  The
	pattern of the presentation is a story.  Just as stories 
	about people can be told in words, or music, or dance,
	or drama, a story about software can be told in different
	ways.
	<p>
	The four modes used in the book:
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Straight explanatory prose
		<li>Analogies
		<li>A single continued visual model
		<li>Source code
	</ul>
	<p>
	I try to express every important idea in the book in
	all four of these modes.  Some people
	think visually, some think in coded algorithms,
	some think in clear prose, and some remember
	analogies well.  Most people respond to some
	combination of modes.  
	<p>
<dt>Using this Approach
<dd>
	I use a simple algorithm to apply this approach to devise
	new classes, assignments, and tests.  I start with a program 
	or an idea I want to discuss.  I look through /bin, /usr/bin, 
	/sbin, /usr/sbin for interesting, useful programs related to 
	the topic.  
	I look for programs that apply the concepts and techniques and
	are at a suitable level of complexity for the class.
	I then dissect the program into major ideas and techniques and
	write smaller programs to focus on each of those ideas and 
	techniques.
	<p>
	Finally, I build a presentation or project based on the three 
	questions: What does it do? How does it work?  How do we write one?
