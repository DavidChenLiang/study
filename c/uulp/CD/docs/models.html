<dt>Open Source Images
<dd>
	The book uses visual metaphors, depicting abstract systems
	as physical machines.  To create these images, I first made 
	3D models using a program called FormZ.  These models are
	effectively the source code for the images in the book.
	I included some of the models on this CD.  The models are 
	saved in three file formats: native FormZ, DXF version 2.6, 
	and Quicktime 3DMF.
	<p>

<dt>What Are They for?
<dd>
	<i>New Images</i>
	<p>
	With a suitable rendering and/or modeling program, you
	can read these files and generate new images to supplement
	your teaching.  
	<p>
	<i>Movies</i>
	<p>
	These models could be used in programs that make computer
	generated animation.  Someone skilled with one of these
	programs could animate the action of fork and exec, or
	show how data travel from the disk to kernel buffers to
	processes.
	<p>

<dt>Let Me Know
<dd>
	I would love to see if anyone does something interesting
	with these models.  In particular, I would like to know
	if they help students understand Unix programming better.
	I work a lot on using visualization to explain abstract 
	topics, so I wonder if these can be helpful to other people.
	</p>
	<p>
	I publish these models as free software, subject to the
	terms of the GPL.  If you distribute images or movies
	derived from the models, please distribute the source files 
	and attribute the origins of the images to models 
	from <i>IRCD for Understanding Unix/Linux 
	Programming</i> by Bruce Molay.
