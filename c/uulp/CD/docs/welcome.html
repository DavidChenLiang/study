<P>
Thank you for your interest in using <i>Understanding Unix/Linux
Programming</i> for your course. I prepared this CD to make it
easy for you to teach a course based on the book.  This CD
includes everything you need to teach a course: lecture
outlines, classroom handouts, homework projects, final exams,
and lots of graphics.  The CD also includes source code for all
the programs in the book as well as the sources for the images
in the book.
</p>

<p>
In outline, this CD contains:
<ol>
	<li>Classroom material
	<ul>
		<li>Lecture Outlines
		<li>Sample programs for class
		<li>Listings of class sample programs
		<li>What to write on the board/Slideshow
		<li>Thumbnail pictures of slideshow
	</ul>
	<li>Solutions to programming exercises
	<li>All the code in the book (with Makefiles)
	<li>12 Final exams
	<li>12 Programming projects, many with test scripts
	<li>Binary choice questions for each chapter
	<li>Full color images of the pictures in the book
	<li>3D Models for the pictures in the book
	<li>Guides to using the material
</ol>

<p>
I have used and refined these materials in my course for twelve years.
You can simply print out pages from the CD and give lectures.  And
grade papers, too, I guess.
</p>

<p>
Most of the material is <A HREF="../html/chapters.html">grouped
by chapter</A>.  For each chapter you will find classroom
handouts, source code, solutions to exercises, binary choice
tests, and graphics. Material not tied to specific chapters --
<A HREF="../Projects/index.html">programming projects</A> and <A
HREF="../Exams/index.html">final exams</A> -- are in their own
directories.
</p>

<p>
I hope you find this CD useful and enjoy using the book for
your course.  Please feel free to send me email.
</p>
