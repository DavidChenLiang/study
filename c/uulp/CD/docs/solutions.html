<dt>Programming Solutions
<dd>
	The section for each chapter contains solutions to almost 
	all the programming exercises in the chapter. 
	In addition to the solutions is a summary page with links to the code.  
	The summary page explains the main ideas of the chapter 
	and how the programming exercises help students understand 
	those ideas.  
	<p>
	Nearly every solution is a complete C program, ready to
	compile and run.  Some need to be linked with other files.
	Those files are all included in the directory with the
	solutions.  Each program contains, in header comments,
	instructions for compiling.
	</p>

<dt>Big Projects Not Included
	<dd>
	The exercises section includes some larger projects.  
	Solutions to these larger projects are not included.
	In addition to the projects at the end of each chapter,
	this teaching resource package includes complete packets for twelve
	projects.  
	<p>
	When I return student projects, I usually publish on the 
	course site three of four good solutions.  I select programs 
	that take different approaches, code in different
	formats, document in different ways.  Students like
	seeing a variety of ways of thinking about a problem, and
	they probably learn more that way than seeing one person's
	programming style many times.  Also, students are
	usually pleased to have their work recognized as good enough
	to be published.
	<p>

<dt>Explorations Not Included
	<dd>
	These solutions do not include answers to the <i>Explorations</i>.
	<p>
	The explorations do not have single answers.  Sometimes the
	point of the exploration is to learn about details of the
	version of Unix you are using, so the answer depends on
	your system.  Sometimes the questions are experiments; things
	you should try at your machine and then think about the outcome.
	Like experiments in chemistry and biology, the experiments
	with your system do not always have predictable results.
