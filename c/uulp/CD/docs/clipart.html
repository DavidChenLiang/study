	Every chapter includes the original images used to
	make the illustrations in the text.  The pictures
	do not have any labels or arrows; those were added
	later.  You have to read the book to know what the
	pictures represent.
	<p>
	There are two sizes of each image: thumbnail and regular.
	<p>

<dt>What Are They for?
<dd>
	<i>Make Slides</i>
	<p>
	You can use these pictures to make slide presentations for 
	classes.  By adding labels, text, and arrows, you can 
	create your own versions of the illustrations in the book.  
	If you use these in your own presentations, your students
	can recognize the images from the reading, but the emphasis 
	and explanations will match your own way of thinking about the ideas.
	<p>
	<i>Study Guide/Outline</i>
	<p>
	These pictures can also be used as a study guide for students.  
	You can print out each page of thumbnail images as a visual summary
	of the chapter.  Students can review the chapter by looking
	at the pictures, explaining what each component of each
	image represents, and adding labels.  The way biology students
	label parts of a cell or the organs of a dissected frog.

	<i>Clip Art</i>
	<p>
	You can put them on your course web site as decoration and
	explanation.
