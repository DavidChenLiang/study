<dt>Programming Projects
<dd>
	This CD contains programming projects.  These are 
	assignments I have used in my course.  I give students 
	about two weeks to do a project, and I assign six projects
	during the term.  All the projects involve writing a 
	complete program, usually a version of a common Unix tool.  
	There are 12 of them, some duplicate coverage of 
	material, so I use some one year and some other years, 
	and make up new ones now and then.
	<p>
	
<dt>Question, Code, Test Script
<dd>
	Each project has its own directory.  In that directory
	you will find:
	<ul>
		<li>Description of project (in pdf, text, and troff)
		<li>Supporting source code
		<li>Supporting documents (where appropriate)
		<li>Test data and script (usually)
	</ul>
	<p>
	The description explains the ideas, the techniques, and
	questions of the project.  It then specifies what the
	student's program has to do.  
	<p>
	Some projects are based on examples in the book, and some
	are based on code provided with the project.  Students can
	copy these files to their directories and build from there.
	<p>
	Many of the projects come with test data and a shell script
	that runs their code and sees if the output or effects of
	their programs match the requirements.  I have mixed feelings
	about this.  Some students simply hack at their code until
	it passes the script, reducing the planning and thinking part
	of their work.  On the other hand, the scripts identify 
	problems that can force students to go back and work on understanding
	exactly how things work.  All told, they help most people.
	<p>
	If you want to use the test script, you need to adjust a few
	directory names and put the test data and directories someplace
	to which students have access.
	<p>
	Each directory has been stored also as a tar file in the
	directory called tarfiles.  Some of the test data may have
	file types or paths that do not translate well to a CDROM.
	The tarfiles preserve all the Unix file system attributes
	</p>
	

<dt>Three Purposes
<dd>
	I use the projects to teach three things at once.  For that
	reason, the projects offer something to almost every student.
	<p>
	<i>1. Learning about Unix facts and tools</i>
	<p>
	The projects introduce students to various Unix tools.  The
	find, du, last, stty, ac, etc, projects are regular Unix tools that
	are useful and interesting.  As Unix moves more toward purely
	GUI installations, fewer users encounter the underlying role
	of users, files, directories, processes, file types, and other
	basic Unix items.  Each project teaches about a practical tool.
	<p>
	<i>2. Learning about the Unix API</i>
	<p>
	The Unix API is the official topic of the course.  The
	system calls and basic structure can be easier to understand
	when used in this context of practical, common tools.
	Each project gives students a chance to use the ideas and
	system calls from a few chapters in the book.
	<p>
	<i>3. Computer science/Software engineering</i>
	<p>
	Consider recursive functions.  In introductory CS courses,
	students often study the towers of Hanoi or write 
	recursive functions to calculate Fibonacci numbers.  These
	sorts of projects are remote from the daily experience of
	students.  Most people do not move disks back and forth
	all day.  On the other hand, people search their hard drives
	for documents, music files, and programs often.  Seeing the
	recursive nature of that operation links a CS concept to
	the real world. Each project
	emphasizes a computer science idea, technique, or data structure.
	<p>
	The first assignment is a good application of linked lists and
	introduces the idea of virtual memory.  Students are usually
	pleased to be able to write a linked list package to handle
	an arbitrary number of users or terminals.
	<p>
	The second assignment is a good example of recursive programming.
	Those assignments can have short solutions once students realize
	that all tree operations boil down to one recursive function.
	<p>
	The stty assignment is a perfect place to show how to use table
	driven functions to reduce a large number of special values and
	cases to a few simple functions driven by data tables.  Cutting
	and pasting is so easy for some students that they never think of
	making their code simpler.
	<p>
	The video game is really about concurrent programming.  By using
	timer signals, the program creates a second thread of execution.
	Creating a thread with timer based signals exposes them to
	the basics of time sharing.  Replace the interval timer of the
	process with the hardware timer for the kernel and you can start
	to explain how the kernel does multitasking.   The video game
	also raises the questions of race conditions and shared data.
	<p>
	The shell assignment is about processes and fork and exec, but
	the computer science part is about interpreters and parsers.
	Handling variable substitution presents several challenging
	design decisions.
	<p>
	Finally, the network programming exercises introduces the
	topic of distributed computing.
	<p>

<dt>Something for Everyone
<dd>
	Different students have different strengths and different
	interests.  When I talk with students about the projects,
	I find each is interested by at least one of these three
	aspects of the project.  
	</p>

<dt>Grading
<dd>
	I grade on a 100 point scale.  I reserve 30 points for
	software engineering.  That includes design, modularity,
	commenting, and choice of data structures.  The other 70
	points are divided among the functional requirements of the
	project.  
	</p>

<dt>Solutions
<dd>
	I post solutions to the projects after we return the
	graded work.  From the student submissions, I select
	three or four good ones that differ significantly in
	algorithm, coding style, design.  I remove the student's
	name from the code.  Sometimes I include my own solutions. 
	I find this works well for everyone.
	Students whose work is selected are pleased their
	work is good enough to be posted as a good solution.  All
	the students in the class get to see a wide variety of
	styles.  By the end of the term, they see about twenty
	different types of Unix/C programming.
	<p>
<dt>File Format
<dd>
	The project descriptions are all written using troff
	formating tags.  You can convert the file into Postscript
	or pdf with standard Unix tools.  I use the "ms" macros.
	To convert a file into Postscript, do this:
	<pre>
	groff -Tps -ms XXX.tr > XXX.ps
	</pre>
	If you want to to convert that to pdf, you can use the
	ghostscript program, freely available for Unix and some
	other platforms.  Use this command
	<pre>
	gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=XXX.pdf -q -dNOPAUSE - < XXX.ps
	</pre>
	The manual explains what it all means.  gs can also convert
	Postscript files into many other formats.
