WHAT'S ON THIS CD

This CD contains the following:

1.  ReadMe Files

    ReadMe Files are available in both HTML and text format.

2.  Documentation

    The documents in 'docs' directory explain the contents of the CD and
    how to use them in a course. Contents of this section include:

     Greetings from the author

     Teaching: Using the book and CD
         Theory: Project-Based Teaching
         Practice: Running a Course

     CD Contents
          Classroom material
          Homework projects
          Solutions to exercises
          Final exams
          Clipart
          3D Models

3.  Chapters

    The 'chapters' directory' contains Supporting Materials Arranged by
    Chapter. For each chapter you will find classroom handouts, source
    code, solutions to exercises, binary choice tests, and graphics.

4.  Exams

    The 'exams' directory contains 12 complete final exams. These are
    exams I used in my course. Students had two hours for the exam, and
    most of these exams were about the right length for that time. These
    are numbered in chronological order being given in May 1991 through
    May 2002.

    These are not secret; copies are on file in the Harvard Extension
    School library. On the other hand, any student who goes to the
    trouble to get copies of all these exams and figure out answers to
    all the questions will probably learn a lot.

5.  Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0.5

    For your convenience, we have provided Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0.5
    installer located in the 'acrobat_reader' directory on this CD.
