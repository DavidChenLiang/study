	  Topics:   Multithreaded Programming

	  Approach: Study Two Problems

	  Today's New Ideas: Thread, Mutex, Condition Variable

	  Outline

	      Statement of Two Projects
		    Animation in parallel - many animations on one web page
		    Counting in parallel - counting votes, counting words in documents
		    Big Idea: one program, but several things happen at once

	      Idea: A Thread of Execution
		    A flow of control through a sequence of program steps
		    Example: hello_simple.c
		    Traditional programs have one thread of execution

	      New Idea: Multiple Threads (of Execution)
		    A single program can run multiple, simultaneous threads
		    A thread runs a function, which may call other functions
		    Example: hello_multi.c
		    Functions: pthread_create(), pthread_join()

	      Shared Variables: The Two Big Questions
		    Good: All threads in a program share global variables
		    Example: incprint.c - two threads share a counter
		    Questions:
			Can simultaneous access to memory cause problems?
			How does the reading thread know when there is new data?

	      Answer 1: Cooperation - Mutual Exclusion Locks
		    Bad: All threads in a program share global variables
		    Example: twordcount1.c - Two threads update one counter
		    Solution: twordcount2.c - Use a mutex to prevent simultaneous access
		    Side issue: twordcount3.c - Multiple arguments for threads

	      Answer 2: Coordination - Condition Variables
		    Question: How can a thread know when to read a shared variable?
		    Answer: A thread waits for a signal from another thread
		    Analogy: Receiving early voting returns from small towns
		    Solution: twordcount4.c - Use a condition variable
		    Condition variables - The dinner bell of programming
			Threads can wait for variable to be signaled, and
			Other threads can signal the variable
		    Note: A condition variable is used with a locked, shared variable

	      Project 2: Multi-threaded Animation
		    Example: tbounce1d.c - threads for use input and for animation
		    Example: tanimate.c - Multiple animations, multiple threads
