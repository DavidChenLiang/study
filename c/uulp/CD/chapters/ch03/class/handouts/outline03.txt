_________________________________________________________________

	  Topics:   Directories, File Attributes, Bits, File Operations

	  Approach: Write our own versions of Unix programs

	  Featured Commands:
		    ls
		    ls -l

	  Main Ideas:
		    A directory is a list of file names
		    File attributes can be numerical values
		    File attributes can be yes/no settings
		    Bitwise operations ( |, & )

	  Agenda

		    ls1
				   opendir(), readdir(), closedir()
				   not sorted, and does not support -l

		    file attributes
				   owner, dates, size, type, permissions
				   look at chmod(), chown(), chgrp(), touch

		    stat1
				   stat() system call
		    stat2
				   coding yes-no attributes as bits
				   binary, octal, bit operations
		    ls2
				   combine ls1 and stat2
				   still not sorted, and what about ls -l filename

	  Sections

		    1. files have content AND properties
		    2. Using ls
		    3. A brief review of the Unix directory tree
		    4. Is this just like who? open, read, show, close
		    5. What is a directory?
		    6. Can we use open, read, close to get the contents of a directory?
		    7. OK, OK, so how DO I read the contents of a directory?
		    8. How close are we to a complete version of ls?
		    9. How do we add the -l option?
		    10. How does stat() work?
		    11. What info do we need from what stat tells us?
		    12. How close are we NOW?
		    13. How do we decode the type and file permissions?
		    14. How do we convert uid to logname?
		    15. How do we convert gid to group?
		    16. Building stat2.c : format info just like ls -l
		    17. Can we combine stat2.c with ls1.c ?
