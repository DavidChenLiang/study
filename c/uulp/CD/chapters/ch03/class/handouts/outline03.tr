\fBTopics\fR:	Directories, File Attributes, Bits, File Operations

\fBApproach\fR:	Write our own versions of Unix programs

\fBFeatured Commands\fR:
	ls
	ls -l

\fBMain Ideas\fR:
	A directory is a list of file names
	File attributes can be numerical values
	File attributes can be yes/no settings
	Bitwise operations ( |, & )

\fBAgenda\fR

	ls1
		opendir(), readdir(), closedir()
		not sorted, and does not support -l

	file attributes
		owner, dates, size, type, permissions
		look at chmod(), chown(), chgrp(), touch

	stat1
		stat() system call
	stat2
		coding yes-no attributes as bits
		binary, octal, bit operations
	ls2
		combine ls1 and stat2
		still not sorted, and what about ls -l filename

\fBSections\fR

	1. files have content AND properties
	2. Using ls
	3. A brief review of the Unix directory tree
	4. Is this just like who? open, read, show, close
	5. What is a directory?
	6. Can we use open, read, close to get the contents of a directory?
	7. OK, OK, so how DO I read the contents of a directory?
	8. How close are we to a complete version of ls?
	9. How do we add the -l option?
	10. How does stat() work?
	11. What info do we need from what stat tells us?
	12. How close are we NOW?
	13. How do we decode the type and file permissions?
	14. How do we convert uid to logname?
	15. How do we convert gid to group?
	16. Building stat2.c : format info just like ls -l
	17. Can we combine stat2.c with ls1.c ?
