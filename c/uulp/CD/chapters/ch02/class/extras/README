Here is complete source for two versions of the unix tail
program.  The manual explains what tail does.

The bsd version is part of the version of unix written
at the University of California at Berkeley, one of the
major sites of Unix growth.

The gnu version is part of the version of unix written
by the Free Software Foundation, a project started in
the mid 80's by Richard Stallman.

Both programs allow a user to display the last part of
a file, various options are provided.  

They use different techniques, and quite different coding
styles.
