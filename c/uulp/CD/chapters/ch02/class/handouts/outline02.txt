_________________________________________________________________

	  Topics:   Files, System Files, the Manual, Buffering

	  Approach: Write our own versions of Unix programs

	  Featured Commands:
		    who
		    cp
		    tail

	  Main Ideas:
		    I/O redirection, pipes
		    standard directories/files
		    the manual tells all
		    open, read, write, close
		    Unix time
		    `expensive' operations
		    buffered input/output


	  Applications:
		    who0 : writing a system utility
		       the manual, the header files

		    who1 : reading and displaying data
		       the utmp file
		       open(), read()

		    who2 : displaying dates and times
		       ctime()

		    cp : writing data, creating files
		      creat(), open()
		      write()
		      effect of buffer size:
			efficiency, system calls, buffering

		    who3 : making who more efficient
		      more buffering

		    kernel buffering
		      speedier disk access

		    tail
		      lseek()
		      what it does
		      how it does it


	  If Time Permits:
		    exclusive access
		    using files as locks
