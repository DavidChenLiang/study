[Chapter 10]
  10.1) The Unix comm command is designed to compare
    A. any two lists of usernames
    B. any two sorted files

  10.2) A shell script can store data in a file by using
    A. the = assignment operator
    B. the > redirection operator

  10.3) The shell notation "prog1 | prog2" is a request to
    A. send the standard output of prog1 to the standard input of prog2
    B. send all output from prog1 to the standard input of prog2

  10.4) Standard input means
    A. the keyboard
    B. file descriptor 0

  10.5) The input redirection symbol "<" is processed by
    A. the program that reads the data
    B. the shell

  10.6) When Unix opens a file, it selects an unused file descriptor
    A. with the lowest value
    B. that was closed most recently

  10.7) The dup system call copies
    A. an array entry 
    B. the contents of a file

  10.8) The dup2 system call differs from dup in that it
    A. makes two copies of a file descriptor
    B. is given a specific destination for the copy

  10.9) The argument to the pipe system call is
    A. the size of the pipe
    B. an array of two integers

  10.10) When setting up a pipe to a child, the order of system calls is
    A. the parent calls fork, then both processes call pipe
    B. the parent calls pipe then calls fork

  10.11) Connections to a pipe remain in effect after exec because
    A. the array of open files is part of the process, not the program
    B. the parent adds the pipe to the environment

  10.12) The kernel sends the signal SIGPIPE to a process that
    A. tries to read from a pipe with a closed writing end
    B. tries to write into a pipe with a closed reading end

  10.13) A pipe can connect two children of the same process if
    A. the parent creates the pipe before creating both children
    B. the parent creates two pipes and connects them
