<h4>
Remarks about stdin
</h4>
<h3>
Standard Input is a concept, not a place.
</h3>
<blockquote>
When one redirects stdin, in a unix program, using, say, sort < stuff,
it is often said that one redirects the standard input to a file, as
though that is not its usual spot.
<p>
Standard input means two things.  First it is the idea that a software
tool or filter reads input, does something with it, and then writes
out results.  That is the model and is independent of keyboards or
disks or punched paper tape or serial lines.  It is the notion that
data comes from somewhere.
<p>
Under Unix, data flows through file descriptors.  Just as Unix programs
agree that an exit status of 0 means "Ok", Unix programs agree
that they will read their standard input from file descriptor 0.
<p>
There is nothing to prevent a program from reading its standard
input from fd 3 or fd = 12.  It just is not part of the convention.
</blockquote>
<h3>
Redirecting Standard Input
</h3>
<blockquote>
Redirecting standard input does not mean changing it from the
keyboard, it means changing it from whatever it happens to be.
