	  Topics:   Communication Choices

	  Approach: Problems, Tools, Solutions

	  Today's New Ideas: select, named pipes, shared memory, semaphores

	  Outline

	      IPC So Far
		    We have seen several methods for one process to communicate
		    with another process.  We have seen files, pipes, sockets, and
		    signals.  How do you choose which method to use?

	      Theme for Today: Multiplicity in Communication
		    Reading from multiple inputs
		    Multiple methods to transfer data
		    Multiple methods to lock data
		    Printing multiple files on multiple printers

	      I. Reading from Multiple Inputs: the talk command
		    What talk does
		    How talk works: the select system call
		    Design choices for writing talk

	      II. Comparing IPC Methods
		    Disk Files
		    Shared Memory
		    Named Pipes

	      III. Techniques for Locking Data
		    Read locks and write locks
		    File locks with fcntl
		    Locks with semaphores

	      IV. Making Choices
		    Handling multiplicity in printing
