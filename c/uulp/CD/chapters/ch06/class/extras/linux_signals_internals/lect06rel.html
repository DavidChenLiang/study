<larger><b>Lecture 6  Signals</b></larger>
<hr>
	Signals are sent to processes.  Requests for signals come from
	users, from the kernel, and from other processes.  The result
	of delivering a signal to a process can be determined by the
	receiving process.  Therefore, there are four things to look
	at:
	<ul>
		<li>The structure of a process (called a task on Linux)
		<li>The request for a signal
		<li>The delivery of a signal
		<li>The response to a signal
	</ul>
	<p>
	The Linux source code has all the details of these components
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<a href='signal.h'>signal.h<a> The signal() and sigaction()
	system calls use the values and structures in this file.
	<p>
	<li>
	<a href='signal.c'>kernel/signal.c<a>
	The code for the signal() and sigaction()
	system calls are in this file.  The function called kill_something()
	is the general interface that interprets the arguments to kill().
	The function called do_sigaction() examines and acts on the
	values in the struct sigaction.  You can see in this code what
	happens to the values you pass to the kernel.
	<p>
	<li>
	<a href='sched.h'>sched.h<a>
	The receiver of a signal is a task, defined in this file.
	Look for the definition of <tt>struct task_struct</tt> to
	see all the attributes of a process.  Look for the signal-related
	members.
	<p>
	<li>
	<a href='exit.c'>exit.c</a>
	The mechanism for terminating a process, notifying its
	relatives, and waiting for children is coded in this file.
	You can see here who is notified and how.
	<p>
</ul>
