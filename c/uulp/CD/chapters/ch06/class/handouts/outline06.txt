	  Topics:   Even More tty control: Programming for Humans

	  Approach: Use User Programs, Write a User Program

	  Main Questions:

		    How Can I Control the User Input Stream?
		    What Does the tty Driver Do?
		    What does Ctrl-C do?

	  Outline

		    The Big Picture again
			 Today: Getting data from keyboards

		    Software tools vs. User Programs
			 Software tools are attached to abstract data streams
			 User Programs are attached to keyboards

		    Special Concerns of User Programs
			 Immediate response to chars
			 Limited input set
			 Timeout on input
			 Resistent to Ctrl-C

		    Exploring the tty Driver

		    Concrete Example: ATM security
			 play_again0: minimal operation
			 play_again1: one-char input
			 play_again2: one-char input, no echo, ignore other input
			 play_again3: crmode, noecho, nonblocking

		    Signals
			 How they work
			 What they are
			 Where they come from
			 What they can do
			 Setting a response

		    Back to play_again
			 play_again4: catches signals and cleans up
