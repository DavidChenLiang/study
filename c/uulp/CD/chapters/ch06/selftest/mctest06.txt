[Chapter 06]
  6.1) A software tool expects the terminal driver to be in
    A. canonical processing mode
    B. no particular mode

  6.2) Canonical processing mode includes
    A. buffering and echoing
    B. buffering and editing

  6.3) If the terminal driver receives the erase key while in non-canonical mode it
    A. it discards the character
    B. passes the character to the program

  6.4) A user program may limit user input to 'y' and 'n' by
    A. telling the terminal driver to discard all other keys
    B. ignoring all other keys

  6.5) The read system call, used on a terminal in non-blocking mode
    A. returns 0 if no characters are available
    B. returns -1 if no characters are available

  6.6) If the terminal driver receives a key while in non-blocking mode, it
    A. stores the character until a program calls read
    B. discards the character 

  6.7) The signal system call is used to
    A. specify a response to a particular signal
    B. kill a process

  6.8) A program may change its response to a signal
    A. at any time
    B. only at the start of the program

  6.9) A program may change the interrupt key by using
    A. the signal function
    B. the tcsetattr function

  6.10) A synchronous signal is
    A. generated at a scheduled time
    B. generated in response to a program operation
