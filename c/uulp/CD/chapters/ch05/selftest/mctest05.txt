  5.2) The major number of a device represents
    A. the maximum data rate for the device
    B. a way to locate the device driver

  5.3) One difference between disk files and device files is
    A. device files cannot be unlinked
    B. device files use no data blocks

  5.4) Kernel buffering can be turned off for a file descriptor with
    A. the write system call

  5.5) The O_APPEND flag is used to prevent
    A. data loss
    B. data duplication

  5.6) The terminal driver can
    A. change the size of a terminal window
    B. translate lower case letters to upper case letters

  5.7) Changing terminal driver settings for a file descriptor affects

  5.9) A race condition is a result of
    A. unpredictable scheduling of actions
    B. fast processor speeds

  5.10) O_APPEND is not used for terminal drivers because
