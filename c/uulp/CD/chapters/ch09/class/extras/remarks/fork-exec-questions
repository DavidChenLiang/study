The source for curses will show it in detail.  There are several versions
of curses. The original one was done at Berkeley.  A fancier one was
later done at AT&T using barely compatible functions.  An open source
free version was done later and has now taken over the BSD lineage.

The original bsd sources are at:  

    ftp://ftp.uu.net/systems/unix/bsd-sources/lib/libcurses/

and refresh.c.Z is there.  You have to explore the code some to see
how the internal version of the screen is kept and how it knows which
parts to look at.  That earlier code is simpler to follow than the
later, more complicated versions.

   When a the code in a process calls exec() the kernel runs a new
   program in that process.  The pid stays the same.  It is possible
   for one process to chain a sequence of programs forever assuming
   that each program it ran had an exec() to run the next one.

   I am not sure about the reasons for cloning but the benefits are 
   as you describe.

   The question sounds pretty coherent.  Let me start from scratch to
   see if that meets some of your questions.

   Programs sometimes want to run other programs, so an o/s has to provide
   some mechanism for doing that.  One mechanism would be to provide a
   system call named run_program(programname) that would tell the o/s to
   launch the named program.  That would work ok, but there are a few
   questions that come to mind at once.

   a) Should the caller be blocked until the new program ends or should
      the new program go on its way and let the caller go back to its
      work?  If so, the run_program() call would need to take some other
      parameter to tell it whether to block the parent.

      What about setting up file connections or certain priviledges or
      environment variables?  If those had to be set when you called
      run_program() then you'd need more options to the run_program()
      call.  E.g.  run_program("sort", NO_BLOCK, "stdin=/tmp/foo", 
                                priority=x, ... )
      A process can set all sorts of attributes.  If the run_program()
      model were to be maximally flexible, then it would have to allow
      the caller to specify any combination of attributes to apply to
      the new program/process.  

      The advantage of fork() then exec() is that those settings do 
      not need to be duplicated from `set them for me' to `set them
      for my child'. Instead, the same calls that work for `set them
      for me' automatically, through fork and exec,  produce the 
      effects for `set them for the child'.
