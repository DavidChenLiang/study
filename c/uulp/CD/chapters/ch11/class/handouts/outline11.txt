	  Topics:   Connecting to Processes Near and Far

	  Approach: Three Examples: bc, popen(), timed, rem_execd

	  Today's System Calls: socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), connect()

	  Outline

	      More Pipes

		    bc in detail
		       1. Big picture
		       2. Details of implementation
		       3. Ideas of client and server

		    popen() - processes that look like files
		       1. What is popen() ?
		       2. A simple example ?
		       3. Writing popen()


	      Sockets

		    What For?
		       Connect processes on different machines

		    An analogy
		       1. Calling the time service
		       2. Server and client
		       3. address family
		       4. hostname
		       5. port number
		       6. setting up a service
		       7. using a service

		    Reality
		       1. talking to a time daemon
		       2. Server and client
		       3. address family
		       4. hostname - ( see /etc/hosts )
		       5. port number - ( see /etc/services )
		       6. setting up a service
		       7. using a service

		    A Dialog
		       1. remote execution
		       2. using it for file transfer
