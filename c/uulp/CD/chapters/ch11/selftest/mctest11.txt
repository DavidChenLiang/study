[Chapter 11]
  11.1) The bc/dc pair of programs is an example of
    A. parallel processing
    B. client/server design

  11.2) You use the function fdopen instead of fopen to
    A. redirect standard input
    B. add standard buffering to an open file descriptor

  11.3) You cannot use fopen for pipes because
    A. pipes do not have file names
    B. pipes have a limited capacity

  11.4) If a process that reads from a pipe does not close the writing end
    A. that process will receive two copies of all data
    B. that process will never see end of file on the pipe

  11.5) A pipe can be used to transfer data between
    A. exactly two processes
    B. any number of processes

  11.6) Socket connections are similar to pipe connections in that
    A. both use their file descriptors as addresses
    B. processes transfer data through both with the read and write system calls 

  11.7) In Unix terminology, the difference between a host and a server is
    A. a server is process, a host is a computer
    B. a server is smaller computer, a host supports more users

  11.8) A server program uses the bind system call to
    A. attach an address to its socket
    B. lock the socket in memory

  11.9) The listen system call is used to
    A. enable incoming connections to a socket
    B. receive data from a client

  11.10) A client program makes a connection to a server program by calling
    A. socket
    B. connect

  11.11) The protocol for a client/server connection describes
    A. the format of the messages
    B. the format of the source code

  11.12) To list files on a remote machine, a client
    A. can pass the server name to the opendir system call 
    B. must contact a server that lists files

  11.13) The problem with using the popen function in servers is
    A. popen can run arbitrary shell commands
    B. the server has to call the pclose function to prevent zombies
