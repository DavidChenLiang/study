	  Topics:   Internal Structure of Files, Directories, File Systems

	  Approach: Work from user view to system view, write pwd

	  Featured Commands:
		    mkdir, rmdir, rm, ln, mv, pwd

	  Main Ideas:
		    Users see a file system as a tree of directories, files, and info
		    A file system is a sequence of disk blocks
		    A file is a struct of info (an inode) and a list of data blocks
		    A directory is a list of inode numbers and names

	  Agenda

		    User View of File System
			directory tree, files, info, moving around, moving files
			mkdir abuse (don't try this at home)

		    Face Reality
			A disk is a stack of platters, tracks, sectors, just blocks

		    The Unix File System
			Three (well, four) parts

		    Looking at Operations in terms of a Unix File System
			Creating a file
			Building a Tree
			File operations: rm, ln, mv, mkdir, rmdir

		    Writing pwd
			inodes and names

		    Symbolic Links
			Definition, Examples, Directories, cross-system
